# MITWPU – Course Notes Hub

Central hub of syllabus-wise notes for MIT World Peace University (MITWPU) students across multiple programmes and departments.  
This repository is **owned** and maintained by [`saichandangorli1`](https://github.com/saichandangorli1) (primary maintainer).

## What this repo is

- Community-driven notes for MITWPU courses, organized as: programme → department → year → batch → subject → unit. 
- Files can be in any suitable format: `.md`, `.txt`, source code files, notebooks, or other formats depending on the course and subject requirements.  
- Intended to make revision and exam preparation more structured, not to replace official materials.

It is **not** an official MITWPU resource. Always cross-check with faculty notes, LMS, and prescribed textbooks.

## How to use

1. Open the `docs/` folder.  
2. Navigate as: `docs/<programme>/<department-or-school>/<year>/<batch>/<subject>/`.  
3. Open the relevant file(s) for your unit or topic (`unit-1.*`, `unit-2.*`, or any other course-appropriate filename and extension). 

Use these notes as a supplement, not as your only source.
